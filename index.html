<p>Our project aims at exploring the status of women in the world of movies. We will take all movies released in the last five years (2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012)
  vs. the movies released every ten years for the last 50 years (2006, 1996, 1986, 1976 and 1966). 
  We want to analyze how women appear, in acting, directing and writing. We want to see how the ratings, as well as the genre of their movies are compared to those of men. 
  We also use term frequency - document frequency analysis to see which words are more likely to be used in the user reviews, and check the sentiment of the reviews. 
  We get lists of movies made in specific years from Wikipedia, information about the movies returned from The Open Movie Database (an imdb API), and to determine 
  which gender the people on our list are, we use a name gender API, except for the hardest names.
