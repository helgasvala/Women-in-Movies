      <p> In this section, we'll look at some graphs concerning the project. We analyze the movies based on the gender of the director, writer and main star. We will look at the gender distribution in the movies based on various years, genre distribution between the genders and how the films are rated on IMDB.</p>

<a id="women-ratio" class="anchor" href="#women-ratio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The ratio of women in movies</h3>

<p> First, we'll look at how many movies of the ones released in every year we look at are written by at least one woman, directed by at least one woman and have a female star. </p>

      <p> We see that the situation is the worst for women in the directing world. It has improved remarkably little over the span of the last 50 years, with a ratio only two times higher in the year 2016 than 1966, but still under 10%.
      The writers statistics seem good, but we should consider the fact that the requirement that a movie has a female writer is only that one of the writers of the movie is female, and most movies have more than one and more than two writers. </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
